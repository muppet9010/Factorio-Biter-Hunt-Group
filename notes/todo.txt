Next:
    - track player names against raw biter count and apply their names to a tinted gold biter for each player. up health x2 of tinted biters and reduce damage by 1/2 damage.
    - add option to show number of biters left on the hunting gui. should be a __3__ and update on each biter death.


Future:
    - when a biter pack is targeted at spawn after killing their player don't discard the group, update GUI and track them still. As odd to see no biter packs on GUI, but a horde at spawn.
    - a draw option for packs after x time.
    - after a draw or biters getting stuck (wondering) or they wonder after reaching spawn make them turn in to biter nests or die as option.
    - support for other modded biter nest types and limiting the very nasty new biters they add.
    - option for worms to spawn rather than biters.
    - have tunneling effect damage nearby buildings and destroy land mines on that spot.
    - option to spawn in groups rather than individually. "Biters per location", positive numbers is roughly how many biters per spawn location before another is added, negative numbers is a fixed number of locations the biters are devided between.
    - if spawning in groups use unit groups to command in this case and keep units in valid groups...
    - add formula support for biter spawn radius.
    - Groups targeted at specific players shouldn't target spawn if no valid targets. Look to do a random offset and delay any future packs for the group. Also check players are valid targets prior to incoming stage doing anything.
    - add remote interfaces to the commands for future use.
