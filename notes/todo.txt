a draw option for packs after x time
after a draw or biters getting stuck (wondering) or they wonder after reaching spawn make them turn in to biter nests or die as option
support for other modded biter nest types and limiting the very nasty new biters they add
option for worms to spawn rather than biters
have tunneling effect damage nearby buildings and destroy land mines on that spot
option to spawn in groups rather than individually. "Biters per location", positive numbers is roughly how many biters per spawn location before another is added, negative numbers is a fixed number of locations the biters are devided between.
if spawning in groups use unit groups to command in this case and keep units in valid groups...
add formula support for biter spawn radius
Groups targeted at specific players shouldn't target spawn if no valid targets. Look to do a random offset and delay any future packs for the group. Also check players are valid targets prior to incomming stage doing anything.
at start of incoming stage if processedPackSize is 0 then skip this pack and schedule the next one.
add remote interfaces to the commands for future use



Check settings value loading at game start have their errors shown in game chat and not just in the log, as game not running when they fire. Only need to detect on new game: tick = 0 and no connected players may do it.


JD Playthrough:
followers to biters will be a mod setting: proposed setting is: math.floor( (x + (x * (x/4) ) ) * 10 )
Integration to trigger:
    command to add followers to the current group's waiting pack.
    command to reset the random timer.
    command to say-it mod to highlight that a follower has joined the pack
