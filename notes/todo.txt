Next:
    - make targeted players accept a single name out of json format
    - add option to show number of biters left on the hunting gui. should be a __3__ and update on each biter death.
	- make first biter start at a random angle rather than always 0.
	- if a biter count formula is in use have it write to game text the number of raw biters and the formula biter count.

Future:
    - track supporter names against raw biter count and apply their names to a special tinted gold biter for each supporter. Select a highest evo biter type (not spitter) and up its health by x2  and reduce damage by 1/2. Needs new mod settings to control health and damage changes. New command option to specify this special biter or maybe just including supporter name does it given the name isn't used or tracked for anything else?
    - when a biter pack is targeted at spawn after killing their player don't discard the group, update GUI and track them still. As odd to see no biter packs on GUI, but a horde at spawn.
    - a draw option for packs after x time.
    - after a draw or biters getting stuck (wondering) or they wonder after reaching spawn make them turn in to biter nests or die as option.
    - support for other modded biter nest types and limiting the very nasty new biters they add.
    - option for worms to spawn rather than biters.
    - have tunneling effect damage nearby buildings and destroy land mines on that spot.
    - option to spawn in groups rather than individually. "Biters per location", positive numbers is roughly how many biters per spawn location before another is added, negative numbers is a fixed number of locations the biters are devided between.
    - if spawning in groups use unit groups to command in this case and keep units in valid groups...
    - add formula support for biter spawn radius.
    - Groups targeted at specific players shouldn't target spawn if no valid targets. Look to do a random offset and delay any future packs for the group. Also check players are valid targets prior to incoming stage doing anything.
    - add remote interfaces to the commands for future use.
